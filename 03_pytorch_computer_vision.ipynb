The training process implies a gradual modification of the NN weights to minimize a predefined loss function. This process is carried out over several epochs for a given training set. During the training, the gradient (i.e., the vector of partial derivatives) of the loss function with respect to the NN weights is computed via the backpropagation (BP) algorithm.  Then, the learning algorithm updates the weights of the NN using this gradient . The most popular learning algorithms to optimize NNs are Gradient Descent (GD) based algorithms, such as mini-batch GD or Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). These algorithms change the weights in the opposite direction of the gradient. The magnitude of change is controlled by the learning rate. \n","\n","What's a good batch size?\n","\n","[32 is a good place to start](https://twitter.com/ylecun/status/989610208497360896?s=20&t=N96J_jotN--PYuJk2WcjMw) for a fair amount of problems.\n","> The batch size was set to 32, i.e., model weights are updated for every mini-batch of 32 sentences \n","\n","But since this is a value you can set (a **hyperparameter**) you can try all different kinds of values, though generally powers of 2 are used most often (e.g. 32, 64, 128, 256, 512).\n","\n","![an example of what a batched dataset looks like](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning/main/images/03-batching-fashionmnist.png)\n","*Batching FashionMNIST with a batch size of 32 and shuffle turned on.
